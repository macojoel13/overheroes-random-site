Welcome to my first "serious" project.

My goals for this project are to make a random hero generator

for general party like challenges with your friends in overwatch.

The idea came from my actual experience with my friends when playing

Overwatch and we tried to choose a random hero to make bets and challenges,

but sometimes it was hard, and since I was learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,

I decided to make this my first project for the sake of fun,

and to learn on the way too.
